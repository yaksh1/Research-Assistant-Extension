I have created a small project:
This project is a Chrome extension that helps users summarize selected text from any webpage using an AI-powered backend.

🧠 Frontend (Chrome Extension):

Users select text on any webpage and click "Summarize".

The selected text is sent to a Java Spring Boot backend API.

The summarized response is displayed in a result panel.

Users can also write and save personal research notes using the built-in notepad, which stores content in browser local storage.

⚙️ Backend (Spring Boot):

Receives text and operation type (e.g., "summarize").

Uses a language model (e.g., Gemini or OpenAI) to generate summaries.

Deployed via Docker and hosted on Render for public accessibility.


## 1. Colored Note Display with User-Selected Tags ✅ DONE

**📝 Description**
Allow users to choose a color for each note using color options above/below the textarea. When they click "Save", the note is displayed below with the chosen color.

**Status:** Implemented using localStorage. Users can pick a color, and notes are displayed with the chosen color below the textarea.

---

## 2. Summary Length Options (Quick Toggle) ✅ DONE

**📝 Description**
Let users choose between short (1–2 lines), medium (1 paragraph), and detailed (bullet points) summaries.

**Status:** Implemented with a modern toggle in the UI. The selected summary style is sent to the backend.

---

## 3. Citation & Source Mode ✅ DONE

**📝 Description**
Attach source information (URL, page title, access date) with every summary or saved note.

**Status:** When saving a note with citation enabled, the extension stores and displays the page URL and access date with the note. Citation info is not sent to the backend, but shown in the UI under each note.

## 4. Summary History with Keyword Search ✅ DONE

**📝 Description**
Show the last 30 summaries and allow filtering by keyword or page.

**Status:** Implemented. The last 30 summaries are saved, searchable by keyword, and can be copied to clipboard from the UI.

---

## 5. Topic Organizer (Auto Categorize Notes) ✅ DONE

**📝 Description**
Auto-tag each note with categories like "Science", "History", etc., using Gemini/OpenAI.

**Status:** Implemented. Each note is now auto-tagged with categories using Gemini/OpenAI, and tags are stored in MongoDB.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Helps manage research content by theme.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* OpenAI/Gemini topic classification
* Store tags in MongoDB

---

## 6. Clipboard Watch Mode

**📝 Description**
Detect if a user copies large text and offer to summarize it via popup.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Streamlines summarization experience.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* Clipboard API
* Chrome Extension content script
* Popup injection

---

## 7. Smart Auto-Highlight Suggestions

**📝 Description**
Suggest high-value content to summarize using keyword density and NLP heuristics.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Helps users quickly identify important text.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* Lightweight NLP (JavaScript)
* Highlighting DOM nodes with extension

---

## 8. Add History & Versioning for Notes ✅ DONE

**📝 Description**
Every time a user edits a note, save a version with timestamp.

**Status:** Implemented. Each note keeps a version history (up to 10 previous versions), viewable in a modal. Each version shows timestamp, text, and citation if present.

---

## 9. Add Offline Mode (PWA Support)

**📝 Description**
Users can access, edit, and create notes offline. Sync happens when reconnected.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Improves usability on low connectivity.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* Service Worker
* IndexedDB
* Sync logic on reconnect

---

## 10. Deploy Backend with CI/CD

**📝 Description**
Setup GitHub Actions for building Docker image and auto-deploy to Render.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Shows real DevOps CI/CD pipeline handling.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* GitHub Actions
* Docker
* Render.yaml

---

## 11. Auto-Sync with Google Drive or Notion

**📝 Description**
Allow exporting notes to user’s Google Docs or Notion workspace via OAuth.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Makes your extension highly integratable.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* Google/Notion API
* OAuth2 flow
* Background sync scheduler

---

## 12. Rate Limiting + API Gateway

**📝 Description**
Limit number of daily summaries per user to prevent abuse.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Prevents misuse and shows backend security awareness.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* Spring Cloud Gateway
* Bucket4J or Redis rate limiter

---

## 13. Observability Stack (Prometheus + Grafana + ELK)

**📝 Description**
Track summary volume, user activity, latency, and error trends.

**🎯 Why It’s Valuable**
Industry-grade metrics and monitoring stack.

**🛠️ Technologies Involved**

* Prometheus
* Grafana
* Logstash
* Kibana
* Zipkin or OpenTelemetry
